# Osimis Web Viewer

The [Osimis'](htpp://www.osimis.io/) Web Viewer provides medical image 
visualization straight from the browser.

It is distributed as a plugin to [Orthanc](http://www.orthanc-server.com/). In 
other words, the viewer can be connected to most modalities, but also leveraged
through Orthanc's strong architectural extensibility.

2D rendering is supported with the usual tools:

- Zooming
- Panning
- Windowing
- Length Measurement
- Angle Measurement
- Point/Circle/Rectangle of Interest
- Image Flipping/Rotation
- Multiframe support

Have a look at [our blog](http://www.osimis.io/en/blog.html).

## Demo

A demo of the viewer is available at those links:

- [IRM study](http://osimisviewer.osimis.io/osimis-viewer/app/index.html?study=1b4c72ad-5aba2557-9fc396b3-323e190c-07d36585).
- [Full demo](http://osimisviewer.osimis.io/), embedded within the Orthanc
  Explorer. Other studies are available from there.

## What's new

See the [release notes](https://bitbucket.org/osimis/osimis-webviewer-plugin/src/master/RELEASE_NOTES.txt).

## Installation & Usage

The latest stable version is available [here](http://www.osimis.io/en/download.html).

Nightly builds are available [here](http://orthanc.osimis.io/#/nightly).
They are still unstable at the moment.

We recommend to download the binaries for Windows and Mac OS X & the docker
image for Linux.

[This article](http://www.osimis.io/en/blog/2016/06/03/deploy-Orthanc-on-a-PC-in-38-seconds.html)
details the installation process on Windows.

[This procedure](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/osimis/eynLn) details the
docker image installation process on Linux.

For Mac OS X, the procedure is very similar to the windows' one. Unzip the
downloaded folder and double click on the `startOrthanc.command` file.

## Configuration

Orthanc is configurable via a [JSON file](https://orthanc.chu.ulg.ac.be/book/users/configuration.html).
This plugin provide a few optional options as well.

```json
{
  /**
   * General configuration of Orthanc
   **/

  /* ... (see the Orthanc documentation for the other options) ... */

  /**
   * Orthanc options having significant impact on the Web Viewer
   **/

  // Enable the HTTP server. If this parameter is set to "false",
  // Orthanc acts as a pure DICOM server. The REST API and Orthanc
  // Explorer will not be available. 
  "HttpServerEnabled" : true,

  // HTTP port for the REST services and for the GUI
  "HttpPort" : 8042,

  // When the following option is "true", if an error is encountered
  // while calling the REST API, a JSON message describing the error
  // is put in the HTTP answer. This feature can be disabled if the
  // HTTP client does not properly handles such answers.
  "HttpDescribeErrors" : true,

  // Enable HTTP compression to improve network bandwidth utilization,
  // at the expense of more computations on the server. Orthanc
  // supports the "gzip" and "deflate" HTTP encodings.
  // May be disabled to avoid useless image recompression overhead.
  "HttpCompressionEnabled" : true,

  // Set the timeout for HTTP requests issued by Orthanc (in seconds).
  "HttpTimeout" : 10,

  // Whether remote hosts can connect to the HTTP server
  // In development mode, useful to set to true when using docker on OSX.
  "RemoteAccessAllowed" : false,
  
  // The maximum number of active jobs in the Orthanc scheduler. When
  // this limit is reached, the addition of new jobs is blocked until
  // some job finishes.
  "LimitJobs" : 10,

  // Enable or disable HTTP Keep-Alive (deprecated). Set this option
  // to "true" only in the case of high HTTP loads.
  "KeepAlive" : false,

  "Plugins" : [
    // Uncomment one of the following lines according to your platform.  
    // Update the path to the DLL on your system.  The path is relative to the working folder
    // Orthanc will start from.  If you are unsure what the working folder is,
    // use and absolute path
    
    // "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Orthanc\\Orthanc Server 1.1.0\\OsimisWebViewer.dll" // for Windows

## Development

### Folder structure

Six folders are available at the root:

- `backend/` contains the C++ plugin source code (& cmake build process).
- `frontend/` contains the HTML/JavaScript source code (& gulp build process).
- `reverse-proxy/` contains a reverse proxy suitable for development.
- `demo/` contains a standalone docker, proxied version of orthanc and the
  viewer with sample files.
- `scripts/` contains global demo building scripts, it is mostly used by the
  Continuous Integration System. It also contains scripts to build/run the web
  viewer demo in a docker environment.
- `tests/` contains the integration tests.
